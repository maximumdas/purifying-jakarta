## Background

- On 4th of Nov 2023, PM2.5 concentration in Jakarta is currently 16.8 times the WHO annual air quality guideline value
- More than 630,000 respiratory ailments cases in Jan - June 2023.
- The air quality index in Jakarta has reached 157, which is included in the unhealthy air quality category.
- DKI Jakarta's green open space (RTH) is 33.33 million square meters or 33.33 square kilometers. This number covers 5.18 percent of Jakarta's area of 664.01 square kilometers. This number is still far from the statutory mandate of 30 percent.

## Data

### [Air Quality Index Data](https://website-name.com)

An air quality index (AQI) is an indicator developed by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. As air pollution levels rise, so does the AQI, along with the associated public health risk.
